	abstract = {Shallow Radar soundings from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal a buried deposit of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice within the south polar layered deposits of Mars with a volume of 9500 to 12,500 cubic kilometers, about 30 times that previously estimated for the south pole residual cap. The deposit occurs within a stratigraphic unit that is uniquely marked by collapse features and other evidence of interior CO2 volatile release. If released into the atmosphere at times of high obliquity, the CO2 reservoir would increase the atmospheric mass by up to 80\%, leading to more frequent and intense dust storms and to more regions where liquid water could persist without boiling.},

	abstract = {The planet Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25–30\% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice). When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes, creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 km/h. These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the Opportunity rover in 2004.},

Two known asteroids appear in these frames, and 20 sources moving with velocities appropriate for main-
belt asteroids are present. Most of the asteroids detected have flux densities less than 1 mJy, that is, between
150 and 350 times fainter than any of the asteroids observed by
IRAS

than several recent estimates based upon observations at visual wavelengths and are in reasonable agreement
with the statistical asteroid model. Using results from the observations presented here, together with three
other recent population estimates, we conclude that the cumulative number of main-belt asteroids with diam-eters greater than 1 km is (1.2

	url = {http://purdue.edu/impactearth/Content/pdf/Documentation.pdf},
	abstract = {We have developed a Web-based program for quickly estimating the regional
environmental consequences of a comet or as
teroid impact on Earth (www.lpl.arizona.edu/
impacteffects). This paper details the observat
ions, assumptions and equations upon which the
program is based. It describes our approach to qu
antifying the principal impact processes that might
affect the people, buildings, and landscape in th
e vicinity of an impact event and discusses the
uncertainty in our predictions. The program requires
 six inputs: impactor diameter, impactor density,
impact velocity before atmospheric entry, impact
 angle, the distance from the impact at which the
environmental effects are to be calculated, and the 
target type (sedimentary rock, crystalline rock, or
a water layer above rock). The program includes 
novel algorithms for estimating the fate of the
impactor during atmospheric traverse, the thermal 
radiation emitted by the impact-generated vapor
plume (fireball), and the intensity of seismic sh
aking. The program also approximates various
dimensions of the impact crater and ejecta deposit, 
as well as estimating the severity of the air blast
in both crater-forming and airburst impacts. We il
lustrate the utility of ou
r program by examining the
predicted environmental consequences across the Un
ited States of hypothetical impact scenarios
occurring in Los Angeles. We find 
that the most wide-reaching environmental consequence is seismic
shaking: both ejecta deposit thickne
ss and air-blast pressure decay 
much more rapidly with distance
than with seismic ground motion. Close to the impact
 site the most devastating effect is from thermal
radiation; however, the curvature of the Earth imp
lies that distant localities are shielded from direct
thermal radiation because the 
fireball is below the horizon.},
